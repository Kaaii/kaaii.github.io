# Kai Wu
I am currently a M.S. Computer Science graduate student at Northeastern University, Silicon Valley. In 2018, I first enrolled in NEU's ALIGN program, designed for non-CS students by providing an intensive extra year of computer science foundations prior to the Master's courses. During the time between graduating from UC Davis with a B.S. in Neurobiology, I self-studied programming fundamentals in Python. I plan to get my Master's degree May 2021, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning. I'd love to be a part of something that has a positive impact on people's lives, whether that's in healthcare, biotech, or self-driving cars.

Outside of CS, my interests include: nature documentaries, national parks, D&D, video games, and digital drawing.

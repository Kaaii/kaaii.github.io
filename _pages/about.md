# Kai Wu
I am currently a M.S. Computer Science graduate student at Northeastern University, Silicon Valley. I enrolled as an ALIGN
student in 2018, and plan to get my Master's degree Fall 2020, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. My Bachelor's degree in Neurobiology parallels my interest in AI, and lends me a scientific perspective to solving problems. I chose to pursue a career in CS after realizing how much CS is utilized in practically every other field, especially in furthering biological discoveries. It also helps that I enjoyed the creative process of coding, which I found not unlike my own hobbies in drawing and writing. Since video games were a big part of my youth, venturing into CS was a rather smooth transition from my biology background.

# Kai Wu
I am currently a M.S. Computer Science graduate student at Northeastern University, Silicon Valley. I enrolled in their ALIGN program (designed to enable those with a non-CS background a path to a Master's) in 2018. I plan to get my Master's degree Fall 2020, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I also have a keen interest in machine learning, and hope to become more knowledge in both AI and machine learning through courses, work experience, and self-directed learning.

I have a BS in Neurobiology from UC Davis. Prior to transferring to UCD, I took classes at my local community college, De Anza, where I first learned programming. I had only taken several intro courses (C, Java, and Unix/Linux) and one intermediate (C) at the time. During my final year at UC Davis, I thought back on the time I took those courses, and made my decision to get a Master's in CS. In the half year prior to the start of the ALIGN courses, I self-studied Python and programming fundamentals. All in all, I amassed around 1.5 years of CS experience before starting ALIGN, 0.5 of which was self-taught.

In my portfolio, I organized my projects both chronologically and by CS experience, as a measure of how far I've come.

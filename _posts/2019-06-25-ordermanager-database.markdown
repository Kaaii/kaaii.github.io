# OrderManger Database
OrderManager is a database created using Java 1.8 and Apache Derby (SQL) as the final project for the course
 CS 5200 (Database Management Systems). I worked together with Karan Machado to put together a database management system
 that could serve as a back-end for an online store. The database contains information on products, inventory, customers,
 orders, and order records and handles the process of a customer ordering products.

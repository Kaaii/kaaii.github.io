# Bulbasaur Generator
Created for GitHub's [Noops Challenge](https://noopschallenge.com). Generates a randomly colored bulbasaur using [Hexbot](https://github.com/noops-challenge/hexbot) and modifying the .svg fill color. Each click produces a newly colored bulbasaur from a variety of potential hex codes. Created using html and JavaScript.

# Further Improvements
Implementing something similar to different Pok√©mon .svg is possible by predicting where to replace certain colors (hexcodes begin with "#", should ignore white or black (at least outlines), and same hex codes should be changed to the same new color). This process should be automated.
